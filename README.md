# Multi Event Scd Type 2 on Delta Lake

I often come across examples that only explain relatively simple SCD Type 2 scenarios. However, my experience has primarily involved managing multi-event tables, where, for instance, the user profile is distributed across multiple events.

This repository includes an example implemented using Spark and Scala, which builds an SCD Type 2 table. Additionally, it contains a [slide deck](https://adrianabreu.github.io/multievent-scd-type-2) created using [marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp)
